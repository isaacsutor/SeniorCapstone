# S&P 500 Stock Trading Bot

**Executive Summary**
This trading bot will compare three trading strategies in a fun game. It will show the effect and benefits of neural networks when used in trading, and compare that to simply buying a stock and holding it through the market changes. Users will have the opportunity to try to beat the market in any of the major stocks of the S&P 500 and be educated on the inefficiencies of manual day trading. Seeing the benefits of deep learning trading will convince budding stock market enthusiasts to make decisions to make the best return on their investments.

This Program does three things:
1. Lets you trade stocks from a starting profile of $10,000 in an attempt to beat the market
1. Compares your results to using a Neural Net for the same job as well as a buy and hold strategy
1. Points players in the direction of additional resources and information on why to not daytrade
