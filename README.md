# S&P 500 Stock Trading Bot

**Executive Summary**
This trading bot will compare three trading strategies in a fun game. It will show the effect and benefits of neural networks when used in trading, and compare that to simply buying a stock and holding it through the market changes. Users will have the opportunity to try to beat the market in any of the major stocks of the S&P 500 and be educated on the inefficiencies of manual day trading. Seeing the benefits of deep learning trading will convince budding stock market enthusiasts to make decisions to make the best return on their investments.

This Program does three things:
1. Lets you trade stocks from a starting profile of $10,000 in an attempt to beat the market
1. Compares your results to using a Neural Net for the same job as well as a buy and hold strategy
1. Points players in the direction of additional resources and information on why to not daytrade

## How the Program Works ##
* This project uses Dash on Plot.ly to display an interactive graph, allowing players to trade stocks in an attempt to "beat the market" in a simulation fast-paced trading environment. When the time runs out, your results will be displayed and compared to what would have happened if you had simply held your initial portfolio through that time period.
* **IN ADDITION** the results page will compare the results of our Neural Net playing the same game you played to show you the potential of this budding technology when applied to stock trading
* Then you will be pointed to educational information where you can find out more about the dangers of day trading and the research being done on Neural Net stock trading.
